Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, embarked on a joint effort with Le Corbusier to build a utopian city that would act as a shared capital of Punjab and Haryana. It's a modern, Brutalist paradise that was completed in the 1960s and was meant to set the stage for a radical new beginning for India and was one of Le Corbusier's seminal works in architecture.",
